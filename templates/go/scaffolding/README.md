# Go Scaffolding

Organized into directories conforming to the naming convention
[signature]-[invocation] where signature is the method signature group expected
(static, instanced etc) and the invocation is the hint of what kind of requests
the function expects.

Together, these constitute a compound primary key of the type of method
signature (or signatures) the included implementation assumes of the linked f
(user function source code).
