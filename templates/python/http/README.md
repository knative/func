# Python HTTP Function

Welcome to your new Python Function! A minimal Function implementation can
be found in func.py.  This implementation will echo incoming HTTP GET and
POST requests.

Included is also an example project configuration as created by the recommended
"Poetry" tool in pyproject.toml (and the associated .lock), though this is not
required.

For more, see [the complete documentation]('https://github.com/knative/func/tree/main/docs')
