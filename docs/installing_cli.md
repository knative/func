# Installing the CLI

The CLI is used to create, build and deploy functions.  To use it, install one of the pre-built binaries, or compile from source.

## Prebuilt Binary

Download the latest binary appropriate for your system from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-func/releases/latest/).

Each version is built and made available as a prebuilt binary.  See [All Releases](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-func/releases/).

## From Source

To build and install from source check out the repository, run `make`, and install the resultant binary:
```
make
mv func /usr/local/bin/
```
